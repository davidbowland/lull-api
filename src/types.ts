// of ONE shared list -- which stops being a problem when every build generates its own phrases
// from its own random seed. What replaced it is smaller and reads better: recent packs are queried
// and their answers handed to the model as phrases not to use.

// Tagged by shape because the consumers want different things from one call. The tool schema
// requires the tag and ajv rejects a response missing it.
//
//   title   -- a recognizable title of a work. Missing Vowels' preferred shape.
//   idiom   -- a common saying or expression.
//   quote   -- a witty or aphoristic line. Cryptogram's preferred shape.
//   compact -- two or three short words sharing letters. Phrazle's preferred shape.

// back light on a single tag produce zero puzzles of a type.
